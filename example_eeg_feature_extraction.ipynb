    "In our research, we focus on the extraction of features from specific frequency bands of EEG data. To achieve this, we utilize the [mne_feature](https://mne.tools/mne-features/) library, which offers a variety of built-in methods for feature extraction.

Methods in 'whole_spectrum_only' implement there own band-pass filter and are only applied to the whole frequency spectrum of interest (0.5-30Hz)."
